# LittleBytes Application

## Project Background

This is an application built for our client, LittleBites, a chain of gourmet sandwich shops, that has numerous location around New York Metropolitan. The business has a point of sale where the customer can walk in and buy the different sandwiches offered at their location. LittleBites also accommodate catering for events. 
LittleBites chain owner wants system that allows him to maintain track of each store inventory and sales. This system must be integrated with the existing billing system at each store.

## Our Solution  

The development team has reached the conclusion that we should use open source components to implement the store software. This allows the store owner to bang for your buck, at the same time these technologies do not compromise the quality of the software. It must be said that many Fortune 500 Companies uses this technology to design reliable systems.
This is our solution: a django based web application
